note bottom of stream
  Never loads entire document into memory
  Processes one XML event at a time
end note

note bottom of reuse
  Drastically reduces garbage collection
  by recycling Map objects
end note

note bottom of batch
  Controls memory usage by processing
  in fixed-size batches
end note

note bottom of stack
  Uses array-based representation
  for better performance and less memory
end note
